# Styles and Themes

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/themes.html

### Styles


A Style can be applied to 

* an individual view (in a layout file)
* an activity (in the manifest file)
* an entire application (in the manifest file)

### Themes

A *theme* is a *style* that can be applied to

* an activity (in the manifest file)
* an entire application (in the manifest file)

A *theme* is not applied to an individual view. When a theme is applied to an *activity*, all of its views inherit the style settings from the theme.
