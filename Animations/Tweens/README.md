### Tweening

Tweening or inbetweening implies generating intermediate frames that makes a source frame appear to gradually transform to a 
destination frame. Tweens or inbetweens are drawings between key frames which creates the illusion of a source frame gradually evolving to a destination frame.

Tweening can be applied to existing views/widgets. It can be achieved in Android by the *Animation* class

Views can be made to 

1. Move from point A to point B
2. Fade
3. Distort
